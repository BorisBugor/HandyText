Version 1.0

- Release version.

Usage
--------------

First, let's define some text styles:

extension TextStyle {
  static var plainText: TextStyle {
    return TextStyle(font: .Avenir)
  }
}

Font is only required parameter for creating a brand new style, all other params are set do defaults. Instead of copying instances and modifying properties the library proposes more declarative 'cascade' style. Think you need a style for headers based on plain text:

  static var header1: TextStyle {
    return plainText.withSizeMultipliedBy(1.4).uppercase().bold()
  }

  Text for page heading is larger and is colored orange:

  static var pageHeading: TextStyle {
    return header1.withForegroundColor(.orangeColor())
  }

  Somewhere in text will be clickable links. They will have same font and size as plain text, but italic, blue and underlined:

  static func url(link: String) -> TextStyle {
    return plainText.withForegroundColor(.blueColor()).italic().withUnderline(.StyleSingle).withLink(link)
  }

It's remarkable that styles are chained, in other words based on each other. Changing basic style font to .Georgia makes all style scheme look different, but still well aligned.
